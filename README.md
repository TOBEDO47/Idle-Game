# Idle Clicker Game

This is a simple idle clicker game, a project I developed as a software engineering student. It's not a complex game, but a fun little project that helped me learn and apply various programming concepts.

## Features

- Accumulate points by clicking and through an idle earning system.
- Spend points on upgrades in the in-game shop.
- Boost earnings with an Angel system.

## How to Run

1. Download the zip file.
2. Extract the zip file which contains the .exe file and other necessary files.
3. Double-click the .exe file to run the game.

Enjoy the game! It's a simple project, but I learned a lot from it.
